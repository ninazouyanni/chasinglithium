        <p><span class="dropcap">E</span>nergy is like magic—most of us don’t understand where it comes from or how it works. But it is essential to almost everything we do—from checking the time to photographing distant galaxies; without the ability to capture energy, we’d be lost.

        </p>

        <p>We can no longer afford to pretend that we have unlimited resources to power our world. After a century of oil dependence, our society is finally shifting from burning fossil fuels to energy generated by renewables. For that to work the world will need storage devices, and lithium is the best resource we have for storage. Instead on repeating the flawed model we built during oil dependence, lithium offers the world an opportunity to reimagine its relationship to energy and natural resources.</p>

        <p>Like oil, lithium is a solution with human, environmental, and geopolitical consequences. On one side of the world a historically impoverished country sits on top of the world’s largest lithium resources. On the other side, a billionaire is building the world’s largest lithium battery factory. And in another corner, China, the world’s largest e-waste receiver is reimagining its relationship to electronic waste. </p>

        <p>We are far from batteries being green technology—mining and extraction takes a tremendous amount of energy, and we have yet to come up with a sustainable solution for the millions of end-of-life batteries that end up in landfills. But if we can get this right—from mining, to manufacturing, to recycling—the implications would be profound. South America’s poorest country could reverse 500 years of exploitation by taking ownership of their natural resources; improved storage devices could allow us to power cities through energy produced through wind, hydro, solar, natural gas, and nuclear energy. And China could turn their immense piles of electronic waste into urban mines, full of reusable materials that slow our dependence on non-renewable natural resources. </p>

        <p>Lithium-ion batteries have already upended the old energy paradigm. But the answer to our energy demands is not the only the advent of a better battery, the solution must include how we deal with mining, manufacturing, and waste—otherwise we’re no better off than we used to be.</p>
